I am a fourth-year PhD student at Stevens Institute of Technology (2021â€“present), advised by Prof. [Yue Ning](https://yue-ning.github.io/). My research centers on **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, with a focus on developing robust and trustworthy models that can adapt to diverse scenarios and overcome real-world challenges. Specifically, my work addresses critical issues such as **catastrophic forgetting in continual learning**, **out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization** under distribution shifts, and **graph privacy protection** against adversarial attacks with **Differential Privacy (DP)**.

I am also enthusiastic about applying GNNs and other advanced machine learning methods to solve real-world problems across domains such as **societal event prediction** and **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** prediction. My work on permeability prediction with GNNs also highlights the potential of cutting-edge deep learning techniques in **AI for science**.

With the rapid advancements in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, I see immense potential in leveraging them to enhance the generalizability of GNNs. I am also eager to explore **Graph Foundation Models**. 

Feel free to reach out if you share similar research interests or have innovative ideas in these areas. I am always open to discussions and collaborations!
